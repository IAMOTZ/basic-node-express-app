# Basic Node Express App
A basic node-express server with support for ES6 transpiling, linting, adding environment variables.

## How to use it:
- Clone the app
- Change into the project directory 
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the app
- By default, the app should start on port `7000` but you can override this by adding a `PORT` value in the environment.
